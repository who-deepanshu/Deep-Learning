# Bag Of Words
- A statistical language model used to analyze text and documents based on word count. The model does not account for word order within a document.
- It's like creating a dictionary with unique words in a paragraph and also keeping count/frquency of each word. 
- The one major disadvantage of BOWs is that it doesn't capable of determining words priority or importance with other words.
